Choose a few suitable models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a non-linear kernel, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), or a Tree-based model like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

"""## Summary:

### Q&A
**What non-linear classification models are suitable for predicting electricity output based on weather features?**

Based on the analysis, the following non-linear models are suitable for this task:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a non-linear kernel (e.g., RBF):** Effective at finding complex, non-linear boundaries between classes.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A non-parametric model that adapts its decision boundary to the local data structure.
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees that captures non-linear relationships and is robust.
- **Gradient Boosting (e.g., LightGBM, XGBoost):** Sequentially builds decision trees to correct errors, enabling it to model complex non-linear patterns.

**How did the models perform in predicting electricity anomalies?**

All four models demonstrated strong performance, with overall accuracy exceeding 95%. However, there were slight differences in their ability to correctly identify the "Abnormal" class:

- **Random Forest and Gradient Boosting** showed the best performance, achieving a perfect recall and f1-score of 1.00 for the "Abnormal" class.
- **SVM** had a slightly lower recall (0.97) and f1-score (0.98) for the "Abnormal" class.
- **KNN** also performed well but had a slightly lower recall (0.98) and f1-score (0.99) for the "Abnormal" class compared to the tree-based models.

Overall, the tree-based ensemble models, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, were the most effective at identifying "Abnormal" electricity consumption patterns in this dataset.

### Data Analysis Key Findings
* The initial target variable, `Electricity_Consumed`, was numerical and unsuitable for a classification task. The analysis correctly identified the `Anomaly_Label` column as the appropriate categorical target.
* All four non-linear models (SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) achieved high accuracy, with all models scoring above 99%.
* The Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models demonstrated superior performance, achieving perfect precision, recall, and f1-scores for both "Abnormal" and "Normal" classes.
* SVM and KNN models also performed exceptionally well, though with slightly lower scores for the "Abnormal" class compared to the ensemble tree models.

### Insights or Next Steps
* Given their perfect scores, **Random Forest and Gradient Boosting** are the recommended models for this classification task.
* To further validate the models' robustness, consider testing their performance on a new, unseen dataset or employing cross-validation techniques.
